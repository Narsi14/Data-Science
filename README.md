## End to End Data Science Project

### Project Overview

This the complete generalized Machine Learning Project. It can be applicable on any machine Learning Datasets.
The project is Divide into 3 parts:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Transformation
3. Model Training

### Data Ingestion
The data ingestion is the first step in the data science project. It is the process of getting the data from the Dataset and
preparing it for the next step. The data ingestion is the most important step in the data science 
project. It is the process of getting the data from the Dataset and preparing it for the next step.
In Data Ingestion we split the DataSet into train, test datasets by using train_test_split function in the sklearn.model_selection module.
In this stage we used to store the train data and test data in train.csv,test.csv files.

### Data Tansformation
This script is used to transform and prepare data for analysis. It contains several functions that help to clean, manipulate, and convert data into a suitable format for modeling.

#### Importing Libraries

The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas and numpy, which are popular data science libraries in Python.

#### Data Cleaning Function

The clean_data function is used to clean the data by removing missing values, handling outliers, and converting data types.

#### Data Transformation Function

The transform_data function is used to transform the data by applying various transformations such as scaling, encoding, and feature engineering.

#### Data Splitting Function

The split_data function is used to split the data into training and testing sets.
### Model Training

This script is used to train machine learning models on a given dataset. It contains functions to train, evaluate, and save models.

#### Importing Libraries

The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as sklearn for machine learning, and xgboost for extreme gradient boosting.

#### Model Training Function

The train_model function is used to train a machine learning model on a given dataset. It takes the dataset, model type, and hyperparameters as inputs and returns a trained model.

#### Model Evaluation Function

The evaluate_model function is used to evaluate the performance of a trained model on a test dataset. It takes the model, test dataset, and evaluation metrics as inputs and returns the evaluation results.

#### Model Saving Function

The save_model function is used to save a trained model to a file. It takes the model and file path as inputs.
