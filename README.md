## End to End Data Science Project

### Project Overview

This the complete generalized Machine Learning Project. It can be applicable on any machine Learning Datasets.
The project is Divide into 3 parts:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Transformation
3. Model Training

### Data Ingestion
The data ingestion is the first step in the data science project. It is the process of getting the data from the Dataset and
preparing it for the next step. The data ingestion is the most important step in the data science 
project. It is the process of getting the data from the Dataset and preparing it for the next step.
In Data Ingestion we split the DataSet into train, test datasets by using train_test_split function in the sklearn.model_selection module.
In this stage we used to store the train data and test data in train.csv,test.csv files.
